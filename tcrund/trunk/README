TCRUND: Transcode RUN time control Daemon.
==========================================

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

TO BE WRITTEN.

Security
~~~~~~~~

tcrund is insecure. Period.

tcrund requires the users to authenticate themselves before to do any 
action, but this was introduced to prevent *accidents* and not hostile 
actions. 

Communications are not encrypted, session tokens are easily predictable.

The server doesn't enforce any resource limitation, so it's easy
to cause DoS on the server machine.

The server has not received any security audit, and very likely it will
NEVER receive them.

Some of the above points will be addressed in future releases, but
in a nutsheel tcrund will remain insecure. Sad but true.

Use tcrund *ONLY* in private, trusted networks.
*DO* *NOT* *USE* *IT* across the internet or any public network.
'Nuff said.
