TCSYNTH: Transcode scripting engine
===================================

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

TCSynth is a scripting language designed for handling audio/video
stream processing, vaguely like awk does for text streams.
It uses the transcode infrastructure and module set and it is
(VERY) loosely inspired by avisynth.
