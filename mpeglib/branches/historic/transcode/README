MPEGlib modules for Transcode
=============================

Designing and implementing MPEGlib, a special care was taken in order to make
it's behaviour as closer as possible to transcode (and, in second chance, to
mplayer/mencoder), while still remaining standard-compliant and correct.

To test, and improve, such capabilities, we provide some sample modules,
and some tools which aims to be very close to the more generic 
transcode ones. See ../tools/mp{probe, extract, ...}


TODO:
- add audio capabilities to import_mpeg: mp2/3, pcm, ac3
