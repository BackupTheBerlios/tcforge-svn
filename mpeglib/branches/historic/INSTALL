INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS FOR MPEGlib
=============================================================================

PREREQUISITES:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
A standard POSIX essential environment. You need:
- a bourne compatible shell (bash to run regression test)
- the GNU coreutils or equivalent package
- GNU make, but BSD make should also work (untested, yet)
- GCC >= 3.3.x. GCC >= 2.95.x should work too, but is untested
  and unsupported

DEPENDENCIES:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
None. Just libc and development packages.

HOW TO BUILD:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'ts straightforward: run ./configure, and then run make.
Giving options to ./configure you can tune various aspect
of MPEGlib. If you want a shared version of MPEGlib (disabled by default),
use the option --enable-shared at ./configure.
To enable the build of example programs (disabled by default,
but recommended and needed for regression tests), use --enable-tools.
Default install prefix is '/usr/local', you can override it
using (surprise! :) ) the --prefix option.
You can get the full list of configuration options using ./configure --help.
When you are satisfied with the configuration options, you can build
the library simply giving "make".

HOW TO INSTALL:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
If make ends succesfully (aka if you do not see any errors on the "make"
output), you can install the library (and the header files, and the .pc file
and so on...) using "make install".
To uninstall library (and the header files, and...), you can use 
"make uninstall".
WARNING: if you use "make clean" between "make install" and "make uninstall",
or if you wipe out the source code directory, or so, you *MUST* redo an
"./configure" using the SAME parameters of previous time. 
Otherwise make uninstall will not work.

If you enable shared library support, do not forget to do
/sbin/ldconfig -v as root to update the dynamic linker cache, after
'make install' or 'make uninstall'.
Actually, Makefile does not do this automatically. 
This should change in fututure releases.
