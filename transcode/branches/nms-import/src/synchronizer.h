 * tc_sync_init:
 *    initializes the Synchronizer engine by using one track

 *    are mangled the less as is possible by the Synchronizer engine.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *       vob: pointer to a vob_t structure describing the import streams.
 *    method: sync method to use for A/V syncrhonization.
 *    master: select the master source. Only TC_AUDIO or TC_VIDEO
 *            are meaningful.
 *            NOTE that some sync algorythms can support just one kind of
 *            source as master.
 * Return Value:
 *     TC_OK if succesfull,
 *     TC_ERROR on error or the sync method is unknown. The exact
 *     reason of the error is tc_log()'d out.

 *     TC_ERROR on error; the exact error reason is tc_log()'d out.
 * Side Effects:

 * tc_sync_get_{video,audio}_frame:
 *     get a new _synchronized_ video or audio frame. 
 *     The code using the Synchronizer engine should no longer worry about
 *     *source* A/V sync as long as it gets the frames from it instead then
 *     pulling directly from the demuxer.
 *     
 *     The Synchronizer engine will fetch an unpredictable (but hopefully
 *     and usually low) number of frames from the demuxer and mangle them
 *     in order to obtain A/V sync.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   {v,a}f: pointer to structure to be filled with new synchronized 
 *           A/V frames.
 *   filler: function to use (usually exported by demuxer or a thin adapter 
 *           around it) to fetch raw, potentially-unsynched, frames from 
 *           demuxer.
 *      ctx: opaque data to be passed to the filler function.
 * Return Value:
 *    TC_OK if succesfull,
 *    TC_ERROR otherwise. The exact error reason will be tc_log()'d out.
 * Side Effects:
 *    An impredictable (from the client code viewpoint) number of calls
 *    to the demuxer layer will be issued.
