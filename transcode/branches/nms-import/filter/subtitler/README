Subtitler -0.8.2
tested on transcode-0.6.11


Subtitler 'filter' to be used with transcode
I do not like the name 'filter' it is scientifically incorrect,
Subtitler does not filter (out) anything, it ADDS data (text).
'plugin' would be better perhaps.

This is Linux software.
released under the GPL.

If anything does not work, it is because I changed a 100 things,
since I am changing things all the time, have a look at obvious things,
or mail me.
Subtitler has already made many hours of subtitled DivX movies.
This distribution is just a hand made copy of some files in my transcode
directory.
--


Copy the source .h and .c files to
transcode-xxxxx/filter/subtitler/
(xxx is the current version of transcode)
Type
make
make install
in this directory.

Make a directory /root/.xste/fonts/

Test:
Subtitler looks by default at /root/.xste/fonts/
for truetype fonts (.ttf)
Run (and perhaps edit font path)
./test-demo
Try uncommenting some things in the demo.ppml.


NOTE:
ONLY if you have the ImageMagick package installed, you can try xsize, ysize,
dxsize, dysize on pictures and movies.
Subtitler uses the 'mogrify' program from the ImageMagick distribution
for resizing.

There are other experiments of mine in the subtitler code, one removes white
stripes from Umatic tapes (drop outs) by replacing these with data from a
previous frame...
None of that code is finished, so ....


Stability:
This thing has been running for 24 hours several days, alas without the X11
routines I added today, .. should work OK.
