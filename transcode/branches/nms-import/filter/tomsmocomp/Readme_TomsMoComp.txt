Okay, on to business.

TomsMoComp.dll is a filter (for Avisynth and DScaler 4.0) that uses motion compensation
and adaptive processing to deinterlace video source. It uses a variable amount of CPU
time based upon the user specified SearchEffort parameter.  The SearchEffort may currently be
set anywhere from 0 (a smarter Bob) to about 30 (too CPU intensive for everybody). Only certain
values are actually implemented (currently 0,1,3,5,9,11,13,15,19,21,max) but the nearest value
will be used.  Values above 15 have not been well tested and should probably be avoided for now.

(Note from Matthias Hopf <mat@mshopf.de>: It seems to be that all higher modes starting
with '15' are somewhat broken and introduce dot noise.)

TomsMoComp should run on all MMX machines or higher. It has also has some added code
for 3DNOW instructions for when it is running on a K6-II or higher and some SSEMMX
for P3 & Athlon.


***************

For DScaler:

TomsMoComp will be included with future releases of DScaler but to test with a current alpha
R4.0 release just unzip the DI_TomsMoComp.dll file into your DScaler folder. Then restart
DScaler and choose Settings/Deinterlace/TomsMoComp as your deinterlace method.

You may also want to leave Auto Pulldown Detection turned on because TomsMoComp is strictly
for pure video source and does not offer the implied pulldown removal of methods like
Greedy (High Motion).  If you are getting jerkiness or dropped frames you should lower
the SearchEffort value (default 5).


***************

For Avisynth:

Just unzip the TomsMoComp.dll from the Avisynth zip folder into your Avisynth directory, or
somewhere. As the script below shows, I made a subdirectory under Avisynth just to keep it separate.

Sample avs script:

LoadPlugin("d:\AVISynth\TomsMoComp\Release\TomsMoComp.dll")
clip = AVISource("c:\vcr\bikes.avi")
return clip.TomsMoComp(-1,5,1)

Of course replace the file and directory names with your own and supply the desired integer
values for parameters.

The above avs file specifies for TopFirst=auto, SearchEffort=5, and a Vertical Filter option to be
turned on.

A WARNING FOR DEVELOPERS

There is a quirk in TomsMoComp inline assembly code or in VS6 such that it will crash
if compiled with C optimizations (or at least auto inlining) turned on. They must
be OFF. Since all the work is done in assembly anyway you don't need them. I'll
figure it out someday.


***************

TomsMoComp Parm list:

  TomsMoComp(TopFirst, SearchEffort, VerticalFilter)

All the values are integer, 0=no, 1=yes:

  TopFirst - assume the top field, lines 0,2,4,... should be displayed first.
    The default is the supposedly more common BottomFirst (not for me). You may
	have to bring it up in Virtualdub and look at a few frames to see which
	looks best. (0=BottomFirst, 1=TopFirst)

	New - setting TopFirst=-1 will automatically pick up whatever Avisynth reports.

  SearchEffort - determines how much effort (CPU time) will be used to find
    moved pixels. Currently numbers from -1 to 30 with 0 being practically
	just a smarter bob and 30 being fairly CPU intensive.

	For Avisynth only, a value of -1 is supported. In this case the TomsMoComp
	filter will not deinterlace but instead assume you already have progressive
	frames but want to double the vertical size.  I found by accident that this could
	give slightly better apparent detail than regular scaling algorithms and is useful
	for low bit rate captures that are hard to IVTC/deinterlace or where you have just
	kept the even fields for some other reason.  I'm considering making a DirectShow
	version of this to be run at display time, or possibly adding it to ffDshow.


  VerticalFilter - If turned on will very slightly blend each pair of horizontal lines
    together.  This loses only a small amount of vertical resolution but is probably
	a good idea as it can somewhat hide remaining deinterlace artifacts and will
	probably also make you clip compress a bit better. (0 = no filter, 1 = filter)

***

Known issues and limitations (for both DScaler and Avisynth):

1) 	Assumes YUV (YUY2 or YV12) Frame Based input. Use an Avisynth function to convert first if
    needed.  YV12 is supported by the 2.5 Avisynth Alpha version only.

2)  Currently still requires the pixel width to be a multiple of 4. This probably
    shouldn't be required but I pilfered the code from some of my other filters.
	Sorry, I'll fix it later.

3)  So far it has only been tested on SSEMMX machines. (now others)

4)  TomsMoComp is for pure video source material. Use IVTC, DeComb, or DScaler's
    Auto Pulldown processing for mixed or film source material.


Temporary file locations:

For now, both source, this readme, and DLL should be at:

	www.trbarry.com/TomsMoComp.zip


A copy of this Readme_TomsMoComp.txt file should be at:

	www.trbarry.com/Readme_TomsMoComp.txt

The source is included in above zip file and also in the TomsMoComp directory
of the DScaler project at SourceForge, www.sourceforge.org (including Avisynth version)
