.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP

\fBtranscode\fR
is a linux text\-console utility for video stream processing, running on a platform that supports shared libraries and threads\&.
.PP
It supports a huge range of options, as described in detail in further section\&. Only one option is mandatory:
\fB\-i name\fR, for supplying the input main (video) source\&. All other options are discretionary and they can be skipped\&. Most commonly needed options are
\fB\-o\fR,
\fB\-y\fR,
\fB\-w\fR,
\fB\-a\fR,
\fB\-b\fR,
\fB\-M\fR,
\fB\-F\fR
and a fair number of transcode session needs a little more than those\&. See section below for full description of all transcode options\&.
.PP
Decoding and encoding is done by loading modules that are responsible for feeding transcode with raw video/audio streams (import modules) and encoding the frames (export modules)\&.
.PP
It supports elementary video and audio frame transformations, including de\-interlacing or fast resizing of video frames and loading of external filters\&.
.PP
A number of modules are included to enable import of DVDs on\-the\-fly, MPEG elementary (ES) or program streams (VOB), MPEG video, Digital Video (DV), YUV4MPEG streams, NuppelVideo file format, AVI based codecs and raw or compressed (pass\-through) video frames and export modules for writing DivX;\-), XviD, DivX 4\&.xx/5\&.xx or uncompressed AVI and raw files with MPEG, AC3 (pass\-through) or PCM audio\&.
.PP
Additional export modules to write single frames (PPM) or YUV4MPEG streams are available, as well as an interface import module to the avifile library\&.
.PP
It\'s modular concept is intended to provide flexibility and easy user extensibility to include other video/audio codecs or filetypes\&. A set of tools is included to demux (tcdemux), extract (tcextract) and decode (tcdecode) the sources into raw video/audio streams for import, probing (tcprobe) and scanning (tcscan) your sources and to enable post\-processing of AVI files, fixing AVI file header information (avifix), merging multiple files (avimerge), splitting large AVI files (avisplit) to fit on a CD and avisync to correct AV\-offsyncs\&.

audio output samplerate [Hz], bits per sample and channels [as input]\&. The option "\-J resample" must be provided for export modules not capable of re\-sampling\&. Samplerate and bits per sample can be specified as 0 to mean "same as input"; this allows converting from stereo to mono while leaving the other parameters alone (\-E 0,0,1)\&.

\fI"drop field / half height"\fR
drop every other field and keep half height\&.
.RE
.PP

.RS 4

\fI"interpolate scanlines / blend frames"\fR
linear blend (similar to \-vop pp=lb in mplayer) this, like linear blend calculates the odd rows as the average of the surrounding even rows, and also calculates the even rows as an average of the original even rows and also calculates the even rows as an average of the original odd rows and averages the calculated and original rows\&. Something like avg (avg(row1,row3), avg(row2, row4))
.RE
.RE
.PP
\fB\-J \fR \fIfilter1[,filter2[,\&.\&.\&.]]\fR
.RS 4
apply external filter plugins [off]\&. The avalaible import modules and their options are documented into the
\fItranscode_filter(1)\fR
manual page\&.
\fINote:\fR
You can specify more than one \-J argument\&. The order of filter arguments specify in which order the filters are applied\&. Note also, for transcode internally it makes no difference whether you do "\-J filter1 \-J filter2" or "\-J filter1,filter2"\&. Use \'tcmodinfo \-i
\fINAME\fR\' to get more information about the filter_\fINAME\fR\&. Not all filters support this but most of them do\&. Some of the filter plugins have additional documentation in the docs/ directory\&.

.RE
.PP
\fB\-K \fR
.RS 4
enable black/white by removing colors mode (grayscale) [off]\&. Please note this does not necessarily lead to a smaller image / better compression\&. For YUV mode, this is done by emptying the chroma planes, for RGB mode a weightend grayscale value is computed\&.

.PP
\fIOverview\fR
.RS 4
The import code takes care that the right video frames go together with the right audio frame\&. This can sometimes be a complex task and transcode tries to aid you as much as possible\&.
\fIWARNING:\fR
It does make a difference if you (the user) specifies a demuxer to use or if transcode resp\&. tcprobe(1) chooses the one which it thinks is right for your material\&. This is done on purpose to avoid mystic side\-effects\&. So think twice, wether you specify a demuxer or let transcode choose one or you might end up with an off\-sync result\&. The modes 0\-4 are the historical transcode ones\&. They deal only with MPEG\-like material and they can sometimes be ineffective\&. Modes starting from 5 are the new ones using the new synchronizer infrastructure\&. Those modes can be used with any kind of source material\&. The only drawback is that they are still under development\&.
.RE
.PP

.RS 4
select export format\&. Default is mp3 for audio, and module\-dependant format for video\&. This option has two different behaviours and accepts two different set of options, as side\-effect of ongoing export module transition\&. For old\-style modules (current default, as found in 1\&.0\&.x series), argument is audio format ID has hexadecimal value: see below for a list of recognized IDs\&. Default id, so default format for audio exported track, is MP3 (0x55)\&. If you are using, the transcode\'s the new\-style encode/multiplex modules (still under development, see the encode and multiplex directories), argument is a comma\-separated pair of export format names\&. Use tcmodinfo tool to check out what new\-style export module support what formats\&.

pass\-through flag (0=off|1=V|2=A|3=A+V) [0]\&. Pass\-through for
\fIflag\fR
!= 1 is broken and not a trivial thing to fix\&.
.sp
You can pass\-through DV video, AVI files and MPEG2 video\&. When doing MPEG2 pass\-through (together with the \-y raw module), you can give a requantization factor by using \-w (for example \-w 1\&.5), this will make the MPEG2 stream smaller\&.
.sp
The pass\-through mode is useful for reconstruction of a broken index of an AVI file\&. The \-x ffmpeg import\-module analyzes the compressed bitstream and can detect a keyframe for DIV3, MPEG4 (DivX, XviD, \&.\&.) and other formats\&. It then sets an internal flag which the export module will respect when writing the frame out\&.

.RS 4
enable multi\-pass encoding (0\-3) [0,divx4\&.log,pcm\&.log]\&.
.PP
0 Constant bitrate (CBR) encoding\&. [default]
.RS 4
The codec tries to achieve constant bitrate output\&. This means, each encoded frame is mostly the same size\&. This type of encoding can help in maintaining constant filling of hardware buffer on set top players or smooth streaming over networks\&. By the way, Constant bitrate is often obtained sacrifying quality during high motion scenes\&.
.RE
.PP
1 Variable bitrate encoding: First pass\&.
.RS 4
In this mode, the codec analyses the complete sequence in order to collect data that can improve the distribution of bits in a second VBR pass\&. The collected data is written to second sub argument (default: divx4\&.log)\&. This data is codec dependant and cannot be used across codecs\&. It is strongly advised to use the same codec settings for the VBR analysis pass and the VBR encoding pass if you want predictable results\&.
.sp
The video output of the first pass is not of much use and can grow very large\&. It\'s a good idea to not save the video output to a file but directly to /dev/null\&. Usually the bitrate is ignored during first pass\&.
.sp
Disabling audio export makes sense too, so use \-y codec,null\&. It is
\fInot\fR
recommended to disable the audio
\fIimport\fR
because transcode might drop video frames to keep audio and video in sync\&. This is not possible when the audio import is disabled\&. It may lead to the fact that the codec will see a different sequence of frames which effectively renders the log file invalid\&.
.RE
.PP
2 Variable bitrate encoding: Second pass\&.
.RS 4
The first pass allowed the codec collecting data about the complete sequence\&. During the second pass, the codec will use that data in order to find an efficient bit distribution that respects both the desired bitrate and the natural bitrate curve shape\&. This ensures a good compromise between quality and desired bitrate\&.
.sp
Make sure you activate both sound and video encoding during this pass\&.
.RE
.PP
3 Constant quantizer encoding\&.
.RS 4
The quantizer is the "compression level" of the picture\&. The lower the quantizer is, the higher is the quality of the picture\&. This mode can help in making sure the sequence is encoded at constant quality, but no prediction can be made on the final bitrate\&. When using this mode, the
\fB\-w\fR
option changes its meaning, it now takes the quantizer ranging from 1 to 31\&. Note that constant quantizer encoding is not supported with some codecs (notably mpeg1/2/4 with \-y ffmpeg)\&.
.RE
.RE
.PP
\fB\-S \fR \fIunit[,s1\-s2]\fR
.RS 4
process program stream unit[,s1\-s2] sequences [0,all]\&. This option is a bit redundant to \-\-psu*\&. This option lets you specify which units you want to have decoded or skipped\&. At a program stream unit boundary, all (internal) mpeg timers are reset to 0\&. tcprobe will tell you how many units are in one file\&.

.PP
\fB\-V \fR \fIformat\fR
.RS 4
select video layout / colour space for internal processing\&. Possible values for this options are: yuv420p (default), yuv422p, rgb24
.sp
yuv420p is default because it is most codecs\' internal format so there is no need for conversions\&. Some modules may not support it though: use rgb in that case\&.
.sp
rgb24 is the old (pre\-0\&.6\&.13) transcode internal format\&. Most codecs do not support this format natively and have to convert it to/from YUV first, so only use this option if you\'re really sure or you want to use a module that doesn\'t support YUV\&.
.sp
yuv422p is an experimental feature and a developers playground\&. Not many import, export and filter modules support this colorspace\&. A 4:2:2 colorspace offers much more quality than the consumer oriented 4:2:0 colorspaces like I420/YV12\&. Most equipment in film and video post\-production uses YUV422\&. YUV422 doubles the precision for chroma (color difference) information in the image\&.
.sp
All internal transformations are supported in YUV422 mode (clipping, flipping, zooming, etc)\&.

\fB\-X\fR
and/or
\fB\-B\fR\&. The file
\fBfast\fR
can only be used when the import and export geometry of an image is a multiple of 8\&.
.sp
In fast mode, a faster but less precise resizing algorithm will be used resulting in a slightly less good quality\&. Beside this (small) drawback, it is worth a try\&.
.sp
If
\fIinterlaced\fR
is given, transcode will assume the frame is interlaced when resizing, and resize each field independently\&. This will give better results on interlaced video, but is incompatible with fast mode\&. Also, the height (both old and new) must be a multiple of 4\&.
.sp
It is also possible to omit
\fIwidth\fR
OR
\fIheight\fR\&. In this case, transcode will calculate the missing value using the import aspect ratio\&. The new value will be aligned to be a multiple of 8\&. Using an additional
\fIfast\fR

\fIinterlaced\fR
is also possible\&.

WARNING: this option will be renamed as
\fB\-\-export_profile\fR
in future releases\&.
.sp
Select an export profile {vcd, svcd, xvcd, dvd} [\-pal|\-ntsc|\-secam]\&. Default is no profile\&.
.sp
If you set this meta option to one of the values below, transcode will adjust some internal paramaters as well as geometry and clipping\&. If no export modules are specified, mpeg2enc for video and mp2enc for audio are used when compiled with mjpegtools support\&.
.sp
Valid values for
\fIS\fR
are e\&.g\&. vcd, vcd\-pal, vcd\-ntsc, svcd, svcd\-pal, \&.\&.\&.
.sp
xvcd profile is equal to svcd except that it allows for up to 9000 Kbps video bitrate (default is 5000) and arbitrary audio samplerate\&.
.sp
When one of the above is used, transcode will calculate the needed clipping and resizing values for you based on the import and export aspect ratio\&. This is especially handy if you want to encode a 16:9 DVD into a 4:3 SVCD for example\&. Transcode internally then sets \-\-pre_clip to add the black bars ("letterboxing")\&.
.sp
If you use "vcd" instead of "vcd\-pal" or "vcd\-ntsc", transcode will make an educated guess if PAL or NTSC vcd is wanted\&. The same is true for the other profiles\&. When the input file has no aspect ratio information at all, transcode guesses it based on the import frame sizes\&. You can set the import aspect ratio by giving
\fB\-\-import_asr\fR
CODE\&.

\fIBits per pixel\fR
(bits/pixel) is a value transcode calculates and prints when starting up\&. It is mainly useful when encoding to MPEG4 (xvid, divx, etc)\&. You\'ll see line like
.sp
[transcode] V: bits/pixel | 0\&.237
.sp
Simplified said, bits/pixel quantifies how good an encode will be\&. Although this value depends heavily on the used input material, as a general rule of thump it can be said that values greater or close to 0\&.2 will result in good encodes, encodes with values less than 0\&.15 will have noticeable artifacts\&.
.sp

\fIBits per pixel\fR
depends on the resolution, bitrate and frames per second\&. If you have a low value ( < 0\&.15), you might want to raise the bitrate or encode at a lower resolution\&. The exact formula is
.sp

\fIAC3 / Multiple channels\fR

When you do import an audio stream which has more then two audio channels \- this is usually the case for AC3 audio \- transcode will automagically downmix to two channels (stereo)\&. You\'ll see line like
.sp
[transcode] A: downmix | 5 channels \-> 2 channels
.sp
This is done, because most encoders and audio filters can not handle more than 2 channels correctly\&. The PCM internal representation does not support more than two channels, audio will be downmixed to stereo
\fINo\fR
downmix will happen, if you use AC3 as the internal audio codec or use audio pass\-through\&.

Lets assume that you have an NTSC DVD (720x480) and you want to make an NTSC\-SVCD
.RS 4
The frame size of the DVD movie is 720x480 @ 16:9\&. For the purpose of frame resizing, the width 720 is not relavant (that is, it will not be used in the following reasoning)\&. It is not needed because the original frame size is really defined by the frame height and aspect ratio\&. The _final result_ should be 640x480, encoded as 480x480 @ 4:3 (the height 480 multiplied by the aspect ratio 4:3 gives the width 640)\&. This same frame size (640x480) can also be encoded as 640x360 @ 16:9 (the height 360 by the aspect ratio 16:9 gives the width 640)\&.
.sp
As the _original video_ has aspect ratio 16:9, first we resize to 640x360, keeping that aspect ratio\&. But the aspect ratio has to be changed to 4:3\&. To find the frame size in the new aspect ratio the height 360 is multiplied by the new aspect ratio, giving the width 480\&. This is accomplished with the transcode options "\fB\-\-export_asr\fR
2 \-Z 480x360,fast"\&.
.sp
To avoid stretching the video height in this change (because the new aspect ratio is less than the original), black borders should be added at the top and bottom of the video, bringing the frame to the desired 480x480 @ 4:3 size\&. The transcode option for this is "\-Y \-60,0,\-60,0"\&.
.sp
If for some reason (maybe a subtitle filter) the black borders (of height 60 each) should be added before resizing the frame and changing the aspect ratio to 4:3\&. One reason for that would be the need of running a _pre_ filter after adding the black borders\&. Then the options "\-j" or "\-\-pre_clip" can be used instead of "\-Y"\&. In this case the black border height has to be recalculated by applying the aspect ratio 4:3 to the value alreadyfound: 60 * (4/3) = 80\&. The transcode options "\-j \-80,0,\-80,0" or "\-\-pre_clip \-80,0,\-80,0" are then used instead of "\-Y \-60,0,\-60,0", and "\-Z 480x360,fast" is replaced by "\-Z 480x480,fast"\&.
