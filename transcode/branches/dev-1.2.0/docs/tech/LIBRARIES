TRANSCODE LIBRARIES ORGANIZATION
================================

(OBSOLETE SINCE 20070427, see html documentation for an up-to-date information)

>>> Introduction

As part of 1.1.0 development cycle, an huge internal reorganization
effort has undergone. Reorganization isn't yet (as 1.1.0 released)
complete, and will involve every component in transcode codebase.
This document provide an overview of reorganized internal transcode
libraries, internal dependencies and purposes.

GENERAL WARNING:
transcode libraries are quite carefully designed and implemented
in order to be independent, self contained as much as is possible,
but they *are not* intended to be easily separated by transcode
codebase and to be used in external projects. We don't care too
much about API/ABI stability yet, and we don't do testing on
this direction. Help us to improve code, or use it at own risk :)


>>> Overview

Library: aclib
Dependencies: None
Purpose:
  provides accleretad, machine-dependent, utility functions
  like memcpy, colorspace conversion routines and so on.

Library: avilib
Dependencies: None
Purpose:
  provide I/O stream access to AVI files. Only multiplexing/demultiplexing,
  no encoding/decoding.

Library: libtc
Dependencies: None
Purpose:
  utility/helpers collection. Provides memory allocation/disposal, string
  manipulation, I/O helper functions. Also holds all low-level code
  shared between modules.

Library: libtcinput
Dependencies: libtc
Purpose:
  input layer abstraction. Provide access to stream data from heterogeneous
  media through a common layer. That's `tccat' program foundation.

Library: libtcaudio
Dependencies: None
Purpose:
  provides various audio manipulation functions used by transcode core
  and modules.

Library: libtcvideo
Dependencies: aclib
Purpose:
  provides various video manipulation functions used by transcode core
  and modules.
