 * Xiph integration support functions.
 * We cheat a little bit here, by including some static (and short)
 * functions into this header.
 * The key point is that these functions will always be duplicated, even
 * moving them into a proper .c file. I'll probably end up moving them
 * in a .c file *and* adding a few more code soon.

 *
 * The following are utility functions for dealing with ogg packets
 * and extradata, needed by all ogg-related modules. See comments
 * in module to learn about quirks and gotchas.
