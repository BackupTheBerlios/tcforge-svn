/*
 * Quick summary:
 *
 * this code acts as a bridge to a running X11 server, allowing
 * client code to query about picture attributes, from transcode
 * point of view, so frame size, frame depth and so on, and allow
 * to grab images when requested (ok, that's still needs some work
 * to avoid async responses and other X11 quirks).
 *
 * PLEASE NOTE: Only *LOCAL* X11 connections (NOT NETWORKED)
 * are supported.
 *
 * Quick TODO (approx. priorty sorted):
 * - internal refactoring
 * - support 15/16 bits color depth.
 * - grab pointer too.
 * - support useful extensions like Damage/etc. etc.
 * - docs for sources
 * - user docs
