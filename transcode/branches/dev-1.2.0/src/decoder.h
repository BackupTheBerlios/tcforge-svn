/*
 * tc_import_init (NOT thread safe):
 * prepare import layer for execution, by loading import modules,
 * checking their capabilities against those requested by core,
 * intializing them.
 *
 * After this function terminates succesfully, import threads can be
 * created and import layer can be started.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *          vob: vob structure.
 *        a_mod: name of the module to be used for import audio.
 *        v_mod: name of the module to be used for import video.
 * Return Value:
 *         TC_OK: succesfull.
 *      TC_ERROR: failure. Reason was already tc_log*()ged out.
 * Postconditions:
 *      Import threads can now be created.

 *      None.
 * Preconditions:
 *      Import threads are terminated.

 *      TC_ERROR: failure. Reason was already tc_log*()ged out.

 * Parameters:

 * Return Value:
 *      None.

 *      import modules are loaded and initialized correctly;

 * This is a blocking function.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *      None.
 * Return Value:

/*
 * tc_import_{,video_,audio_}status (Thread safe):

 *
 * Import layer has the responsability to provide raw data for further
 * layers. Since there always is some buffering, isn't sufficient to
 * check if import threads are running or not, we also need to see if
 * there is some buffered data in the frame FIFOs.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *      None.
 * Return Value:
 *      !0: there is some futher data to process.
 *       0: no more data avalaible.
