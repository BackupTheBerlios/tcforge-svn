This program is for extracting  subtitles from DVD VOB files. It does not
descramble CSS-encrypted files. To compile simpy type "make". The command
line parameters are as follows:

infile=<filename>     The VOB file from which to extract subtitles.

videofile=<filename>  A file to which to write MPEG 2 video stream data.
                      (optional, highly experimental)

subname=<filename>    The prefix of all subtitle files (see below for
                      details on the individual files).

convscript=<filename> An optional shell script, which will invoke
                      ImageMajick's "convert" utility to turn raw subtitle
                      image files into TIFF files.

id=<number>           The optional ID of the subtitle stream to be extracted
                      (default is 0). The specification allows IDs 0-31.


Each subtitle caption in the source file generates 3 output files with the
suffixes ".gray", ".sub" and ".info".

The .gray file is a raw 8bpp bitmap image of the caption. DVD subtitles
however are only 2bpp. in order to see anything with the naked eye using
a program such as Imagemajick's "convert". it will probably be necessary
to use the Enhance->Normalise function.

The .info file is a text file containing information about the caption, such
as its resolution and and alpha channel data.

The .sub file is the raw data as extracted from the VOB source. Details of
its syntax is available from http://sam.zoy.org/doc/dvd/subtitles/
