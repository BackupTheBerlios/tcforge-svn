/*
 * tc_setup_export_profile:
 *     determine the export profile(s) to load later, by extracting
 *     informations by command line options (argc\argv).
 *     In more detail, this function handles '--export_prof PROFILE'
 *     option.
 *     Also removes used option by options array, so later processing
 *     of used option is easier.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *     argc: POINTER to integer representing the number of items in argv
 *           array.
 *     argv: POINTER to array of C-string representing option keys
 *           and values.
 * Return value:
 *     -2: internal error
 *     -1: bad parameters (== NULL)
 *      0: bad option value
 *     >0: succesfull, and return value is number of profile parsed.
 * Side effects:
 *     if operation is succesfull AND if user provided (valid) --export_prof
 *     option, both option and it's argument are removed from argv vector,
 *     so *TWO* items of argv vector will be NULL-ified, and argc is
 *     decreased by two.
 *     This function also trasparently set some internal variables.
 * Preconditions:
 *     argc != NULL
 *     argv != NULL

 *
 * Parameters:
 *      None
 * Return value:
 *      if succesfull, return a pointer to a TCEXportInfo structure
 *      intialized with sensible defaults and containing the values
 *      set by loaded profile(s). There is no need to free() returned
 *      structure, it's handled internally.
 *      If an error happens, return NULL, and tc_log*() reason
 *      (see side effects below).
 * Side effects:
 *      if verbose value is >= TC_DEBUG *AND* a profile can
 *      be loaded, tc_log'd out the unavalaible profile.
 *      if verbose value is >= TC_INFO, tc_log out every loaded
