/*************************************************************************
 * Transcode Framebuffer in a Nutshell (aka: how this code works)
 * --------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Introduction:
 * -------------
 * This is a quick, terse overview of design principles beyond the
 * framebuffer and about the design of this code. Full-blown
 * documentation is avalaible under doc/.
 *
 * When reading framebuffer documentation/code, always take in mind
 * the thread layout of transcode:
 *
 * - import layer is supposed to run 2 threads concurrently
 * - filter layer is supposed to run 0..N threads concurrently
 * - export layer is supposed to run 1 thread
 *
 * So, in any transcode execution, framebuffer code is supposed to
 * serve from 3 to N+3 concurrent threads.
 *
 * Framebuffer entities:
 * ---------------------
 * XXX
 *
 * frame status transitions scheme (API reminder):
 * -----------------------------------------------
 *
 *       .---------<---------------<------+-------<------.

 *
 *  In frame lifetime order:
 *   1. {a,v}frame_register   (import)
 *   2. {a,v}frame_push_next  (import)
 *   3. {a,v}frame_reserve    (filter)
 *   4. {a,v}frame_push_next  (filter)
 *   5. {a,v}frame_retrieve   (export)
 *   6. {a,v}frame_remove     (export)
 * [ 7. {a,v}frame_remove     (filter) ]
 *
 * Operating conditions:
 *
 * 1. single source, full range, no interruptions
 * 2. single source, full range, interruption
 * 3. single source, sub range, no interruptions
 * 4. single source, sub range, interruption
 * 5. single source, multi sub ranges, no interruptions
